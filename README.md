[Techdegree Project 5 - Photo Gallery](https://gracemarsh.github.io/photo_gallery/)

# Photo Gallery
Creating an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and CSS Grid Layout, from scratch using image mockups.

At the top of the page, there is a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. The "back" and "previous" arrows allow the user to cycle through photos.
